# Nothing Personal Wordpress Theme

The bones are made on Storefront by Woocommerce.

Foolishly I did not delete the woocommerce styling stylesheets, so the shop part is not as clean as it could be, but the styling outside of that was done from the ground up.

style.css has been created, but to make changes watch style.scss for style.css

`sass --watch style.scss style.css`
